How to Integrate Metamask Wallet in our website (WEB3)

Before running the project make sure you have: -
-> The MetaMask Extension (opens new window)downloaded.
-> Node.js Downloaded and Installed
-> Install Dependencies

Open your terminal and navigate into the start folder. In this folder run: -
yarn install

This will install all the necessary dependencies we'll need for our project. This will have created a node_modules/ folder where all the dependencies are stored.

Next run: -
yarn run serve
